# Working with DeFi

## Usage

This repo requires a mainnet rpc provider, but don't worry! You won't need to spend any real money. We are going to be forking mainnet, and pretend as if we are interacting with mainnet contracts.

All you'll need, is to set a MAINNET_RPC_URL environment variable in a .env file that you create. You can get setup with one for free from Alchemy

### Run:

`yarn hardhat run scripts/aaveBorrow.js`
